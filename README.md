# Kibatic Datagrid Bundle

Datagrid bundle for Symfony with the following design philosophy : less magic for more flexibility.

It's not the usual one line datagrid generator, it's a more verbose but we think it's worth it.

If you plan on using this for your own project, please keep in mind that for now, we're developing this bundle for our company needs only.
